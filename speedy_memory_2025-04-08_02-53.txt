Sunil Kumar:  We cleared all of them.
Speedy: Congratulations! It sounds like you and your team were able to successfully complete all the tasks or levels that needed clearing. That's a great accomplishment!

What was it like, working together to clear everything? Was there a particular challenge or puzzle that stood out to you?
Sunil Kumar:  Ok, we will do that one now.
Speedy: I'm happy to help! However, I think there might be some confusion. We haven't done anything yet, so there's no "one" to refer to. Are you ready to start a new conversation or activity? Let me know what's on your mind, and we can go from there!
